Whenever we use virtual machines, we want o keep our discounts low, and for that, we make use of:-

# Sustained Use Discounts

These automatic discounts are for running VM instances for a significant portion of the billing month.
 For example: If you use N1 and N2 machine types for more than 25% of a month, you get a 20% to 50% discount on every incremental minute. This discount increases with usage.  
 
 This is applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine.

 This discount is not applicable on:-
 * machine types like E2 and A2.
 * VMs created by App Engine Flexible and Dataflow.

# Committed use Discounts

These are the discounts which are applicable when we commit to using them for a period of time (say 1-3 years) as we have some predictable resource needs.

It gives up to 70% discount based on machine type and GPU.

Applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine.

It does not apply to VMs created by App Engine Flexible and Dataflow.

To get committed use discount:-

* Click on a virtual machine (on the left panel) and then click on committed use discounts.
* Click on Purchase.
* Change the specifications as per the use and click on purchase.

# Preemtible VMs

It is a short-lived VM which is a lot cheaper(80%). It can be stopped by GCP at any time (preempted) within 24 hours. Instances get a 30-second warning (to save anything they want to save).


Use if:
* Your applications are fault tolerant
* You are very cost sensitive
* Your workload is not immediate

Example: Non-immediate batch processing jobs

Disadvantages:
* Not always available
* No SLA and cannot be migrated to regular VMs  NO Automatic Restarts
* Free Tier credits not applicable
 
 To launch a Preemptible VM instance:-
 * Go to VM instances and click on Create.
 * Edit the name and change the specifications as per the requirements.
 * In the management tab, scroll down, and in the availability policy, turn on the Preemptible VM option.
 * Click on Create.

 #### Spot VMs

 These are the latest version of Preemptible VMs, the key difference is that they do not have a maximum runtime just like traditional prremptible VMs(24 hrs).

Other features are similar to traditional Preemptible VMs.
* These can be reclaimed at any time witha 30 second notice.
* These are not always available.
* Dynamic Pricing - 60-91% discount compare to on demand VMs.
* Free tier credits are not applicable.
