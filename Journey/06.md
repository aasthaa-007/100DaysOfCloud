We can reduce the number of steps in creating a VM instance and setting up the HTTP server by:-
* Using Startup Script
* Creating Instance Template
* Creating Custom Image

# Bootstrapping  VM with Startup script 

Bootstrapping is installing OS patches or software when a VM instance is launched. 

Whenever we launch a virtual machine, we want to ensure that it is secure and that all the OS patches, including the latest ones, are also applied; we do this by using a startup script.

In the virtual machine, we can configure a startup script to bootstrap by the following steps:-

* Open the GCP console.
* Follow the same steps required to create a VM instance.
* Allow HTTP traffic in the firewall section.
* To add a startup script, click on the Management, security, disks, networking, and sole tenancy option highlighted in blue colour below the firewall.
* It will open a few tabs, but in Management, one can see the Startup script.
* As per the requirement, one can add the startup script (here, we have to install the HTTP web server)
* Add the commands in the startup script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash  apt update
apt -y install apache2
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
* Click on Save.
* To check if your HTTP web server is installed, click on the external IP address and see your Hello World message on the screen.

# VM creation with Instance Template

Whenever we create an instance, we have to specify all the details again (like hardware, image instance, type, and startup script)


To avoid that, we create an instance template, define the machine type, the image, labels, startup script and a lot of other properties related to the virtual machine, and one can use that template to launch your virtual machines thereafter.

Instance Templates are used to create VM instances and manage instance groups. (Provides a convenient way to create similar instances)

Note: Once created, it cannot be updated (To make a change, copy an existing template and modify it
)

Steps to Create Instance Template:-

* On the GCP console search bar, type Instance template.

* Choose the machine family, images, and firewall, and add the startup script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash  apt update
apt -y install apache2
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
* Click on Create.
* Click on the three dots and select Create VM.

One can see all the specifications have already been selected.

* Choose the region and zone and click on Create.

* To check if your HTTP web server is installed, click on the external IP address and see your Hello World message displayed on the screen.

# Reducing launch time with Custom Images/ Creating Custom Images to setup HTTP server.

Whenever we install OS patches and software at the launch of VM instances, it increases the bootup time. To avoid that, we can create Custom Images with OS patches and pre-installed software.

A custom image can be created from an instance, a persistent disk, a snapshot, another image, or a file in Cloud Storage.

It can also be shared among projects.

Hardening an Image- When we customize images to our corporate security standards.

It is recommended to use Custom Images to reduce the launch time.

Steps to create an image:-

* On the left panel, click on the storage section and then click disks.

* You can see your instance (stop the instance if it's running, one cannot create an image of a running instance), then click on the three dots and hit Create an image. (We are creating a copy of the instance)

* Name the image and fill in the specifications as per the use and click on create.

* After a couple of minutes, the image is created.

* One can see the name of the created image, then click the three dots and hit Create the instance.

OR

* Create an instance template by clicking on virtual machines(on the left panel) and clicking on instance templates.

* Create an instance template and choose the specifications.

* Change the boot disk from Debian to your newly created custom image.

* In the Management section, one can add the startup script.


```bash
#!/bin/bash  apt update
apt -y install apache2
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

* Click on Create.

* Using this Instance template, one can launch as many instances as they want.
